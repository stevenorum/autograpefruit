AutoGrapeFruit (agf) is a set of tools for performing automated analysis of publicly accessible data such as Google StreetView and Google Maps.  It's going to be a fairly random assortment of stuff depending on where my interests happen to lie at any specific point in time.

## agf.gmaps
Tools for getting information from Google Maps, primarily aimed at getting addresses for GPS coordinates and vice-versa.  Also includes some random geo tools (e.g., calculate bearing and distance between two points).

## agf.streetview
Tools for downloading images from Google StreetView.

## agf.photos
Random image-analysis tools.  Right now it's just basic stuff like pixel-counting.  At some point I hope to add smarter machine-learning-type stuff.
